# Python Mini Utilities Project

This project is a collection of basic Python utilities created as a part of the Flipped Course requirement. It contains simple, menu-driven functions that perform mathematical and logical operations.

## 📝 Project Description
This program combines multiple small Python programs into one application. Each feature is written as a separate function, and a menu is provided to let the user choose the required operation. The goal of the project is to apply basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and modular design.
